# End-to-End-Azure-Cloud-Security-GRC-Lab
Hands on Azure focusing on governance, monitoring and compliance. 
# Azure Cloud Security & GRC Lab: Identity, Monitoring, and Compliance

## Overview
This hands-on lab demonstrates managing **Azure Storage Account security and governance** in a GRC context. The lab focuses on **least-privilege access, corrective actions, governance, and control mapping**, simulating tasks performed in GRC Analyst or Cloud Security roles.

---

## Objectives
- Enforce **least-privilege role assignments** 
- Implement **corrective controls** by downgrading overprivileged accounts 
- Document **Access Review** for governance purposes 
- Map risks and controls to **ISO 27001 & NIST CSF** frameworks 

---

## Lab Steps
1. Identified **Owner accounts** from previous labs 
2. **Deprovisioned Owner roles** to enforce least-privilege 
3. Verified **Role Assignments Post-Deprovisioning** 
4. Created **Access Review table** documenting users, roles, justification, and review status 
5. Created **Control Mapping** linking lab actions to frameworks and noting mitigated risks 

> **Note:** Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitoring was also part of the lab; findings were reviewed and incorporated into Access Review and Control Mapping documentation.
